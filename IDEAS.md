    - Teleport all players to a “screenie” location. player’s movement is locked and facing forward to facilitate an easy event screenie. (ik stephen
      will love this)

- find out what other textures spaceniklas has made and what they can be used for

## Game Specific:

### Paintball:

- Integrate more UI elements (sound and particles)

### Sled Racing:

- Illuminate blocks with red/green glow to show clear path
- disable two players in one boat
- Fix interacting bug with boats to respawn at spawn point. (have them sneak out)

### Spleef:

- More layers needed
- Add X number of double jumps available.
- Snow blocks must start disappearing if players are on higher levels for too long (also prevents cross-teaming)
- Snowballs should deal knock back (with cooldown) (EntityDamageByEntityEvent)

### Tree Decorating:

- Disable fucking explosives and lava.
- Autogive players decorations so that their first thought is not to desecrate the tree!

## Donations:

- Christmas tree that grows with each donation
- Custom hats to donators (and/or contributors)
- Donations progress bar somehow.
- "Chaos" donations -> drop TNT in a spleef game, for example.
- A firework spawns above everyone after a donation is made.
- Top Donators NPCs in game
- Donation broadcasts in the chat


## Stream:

- Drumroll while rolling givaway?H

Play-test Considerations:

- Joining & Leaving at various times in the event (overviews, midgame, ending, etc)
- Making sure opted out players are consistently left out of games.
- Join the server as we do map overview. (separate)
