# – Flyte Christmas Event Notebook –

## General:

- After each minigame, commence win animation where all players spectate a camera that cinematically shows the top 3-5 winners (as NPCs) over the
  void, with text and sponsors in the background.
- Leaderboard section in the Lobby.
- Contributors section in the Lobby
- Add a sled slide in the lobby + carousel for static entertainment while giveaways/game selection is happening.
- Spawn random snowballs for players to throw (keep this minimal)
- Hide players when they are close to a leaderboard NPC for visibility
- eliminated players get titles/nudges to donate while they wait (clickable links)
    - On-Screen Banner ads using bossbars, resource packs and displays.
- Spectate Camera (fixed points in a game map, which player can cycle through)
- Staff Utils Menu:
    - Teleport “to me”
    - Teleport all players to a “screenie” location. player’s movement is locked and facing forward to facilitate an easy event screenie. (ik stephen
      will love this)
    - Opt out of games (for staff)

## Game Specific:

### Paintball:

- Paintball projectile itemstacks should be coloured blocks
- Integrate more UI elements (sound and particles)

### Sled Racing:

- Illuminate blocks with red/green glow to show clear path
- disable two players in one boat
- Fix interacting bug with boats to respawn at spawn point.

### Spleef:

- More layers needed
- Add X number of double jumps available.
- Snow blocks must start disappearing if players are on higher levels for too long (also prevents cross-teaming)
- Snowballs should deal knock back (with cooldown) (EntityDamageByEntityEvent)

### Tree Decorating:

- Disable fucking explosives and lava.
- Autogive players decorations so that their first thought is not to desecrate the tree!

Questions:
- are we capping player limit?

Playtest Considerations: 
- Joining & Leaving at various times in the event (overviews, midgame, ending, etc)
- Making sure opted out players are consistently left out of games.
- Join the server as we do map overview. (separate)

## Stream:
- Drumroll while rolling givaway?
